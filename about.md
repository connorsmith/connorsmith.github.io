title: About Me
---

Originally from Ottawa, I'm now in my final year at the University of Waterloo, studying [Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/). 

I've had the opportunity to do a ton of neat stuff throughout my time here, from playing
with autonomous vehicles in Singapore with [SMART](http://smart.mit.edu/research/future-urban-mobility/future-urban-mobility.html) and [SUTD](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), to helping develop the classification algorithms running on the [Myo armband](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/), to working on the 2G/3G signal processing algorithms at Research In Motion (now [BlackBerry](http://ca.blackberry.com/)), and lots more in between!

I also reside on the Internet at the following locations:

* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conthesmith)
* [Strava](http://www.strava.com/athletes/4374239)

As I still don't have a plan post-graduation, so if you're interested in working together feel free to [get in touch](mailto:con.smith13@gmail.com)!
