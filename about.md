title: About Me

## Background

Originally from Ottawa, I graduated in 2015 from the University of Waterloo with a BASc in [Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/). How aspects of a complex system interact with one another is a source of endless fascination for me, so a multi-disciplinary program combining the best of mechanical, electrical and software engineering into one was a natural choice. After graduation I moved to Zurich to join [Rapyuta Robotics](https://www.rapyuta-robotics.com/) and start writing cool software for robots. Since then, I've moved to Tokyo to focus more on the hardware side of things.

## Previous Work

I've had the opportunity to do a ton of neat stuff throughout my undergrad, from playing
with autonomous vehicles in Singapore with [SMART](http://smart.mit.edu/research/future-urban-mobility/future-urban-mobility.html) and [SUTD](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), to helping develop the classification algorithms running on the [Myo armband](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/), to working on the 2G/3G signal processing algorithms at Research In Motion (now [BlackBerry](http://ca.blackberry.com/)), and lots more in between. In addition to [my resume](http://connorsmith.github.io/public/connor-resume_20180207.pdf), information about my past experience be found on [LinkedIn]({{site.linkedin}}).

## Hobbies

In my free time, I can be found [cycling]({{site.strava}}), drawing, [reading]({{site.goodreads}}), cooking, playing board games, learning languages, travelling, watching movies, playing guitar or spending time with friends.
