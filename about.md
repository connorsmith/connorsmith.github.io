title: About Me

## Background

Originally from Ottawa, I'm now in my final year at the University of Waterloo, studying [Mechatronics Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/). How aspects of a complex system interact with one another is a source of endless fascination for me, so a multi-disciplinary program combining the best of  mechanical, electrical and software engineering into one was a natural choice.

## Jobs

I've had the opportunity to do a ton of neat stuff throughout my time here, from playing
with autonomous vehicles in Singapore with [SMART](http://smart.mit.edu/research/future-urban-mobility/future-urban-mobility.html) and [SUTD](http://www.sutd.edu.sg/), to helping develop the classification algorithms running on the [Myo armband](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/), to working on the 2G/3G signal processing algorithms at Research In Motion (now [BlackBerry](http://ca.blackberry.com/)), and lots more in between.

## Status

I'm still trying to figure out what the future has in store for me, so if you're interested in working together please feel free to [get in touch](mailto:con.smith13@gmail.com)! In addition to [my resume]({{ site.baseurl }}public/connor-resume.pdf), information about my past experience be found on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conthesmith).
