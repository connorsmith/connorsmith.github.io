title: Quadrotor Acrobatics
---

During my tenure as a Robotic Software Developer at Rapyuta Robotics, I had the opportunity to work on a series of technical demonstations designed to show off our expertise in mobile robotics and controls.

Over the course of several months, myself and the other engineers working on the project produced a number of demonstrations with our nimble indoor quadrotors and ground vehicles, including a choreographed dance, quadrotor pole-balancing and ground vehicle flips. The fruits of our labour can be seen in the montage video below:
