It's been almost a year since my last post and a lot has happened. As [Sam Altman](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short) puts it so well, the days are long but the decades are short.

When CoVid-19 turned the entire world on its head in 2020, I took the opportunity to return to Canada. Moving from the center of Europe to the west coast of North America in the middle of a pandemic wasn't trivial, but considering this was my fourth international move since graduating in 2015, I'm somewhat practiced at it.

I always knew Vancouver had a great reputation, but now that I live here I can truly appreciate why that is. For me, the city ticks all the important boxes: ramen, craft beer, dogs, cycling, mountains, forest, lakes, skyline, cherry blossoms, public transit...

Job-wise, I'm using my mechatronics skills to develop robots that can search through huge numbers of cells in order to find the rare ones secreting antibodies we can potentially develop into therapeutics. It's often said that your calling is the intersection of what you're good at, what you can earn a living doing, what you enjoy and what the world needs. I like to think that's a pretty apt description for my current state.
