title: Quadrotor and Docking Station Design 
---

After moving from Rapyuta Robotics' software team to the hardware team in mid-2017, I got the opportunity to help with the design and manufacturing of the Beta generation of our drone and docking station. The design goals for the Beta generation were extremely ambitious - in particular, the ability to survive outdoors year-round and the ability to autonomously land and charge. While with every iteration we discover new challenges to overcome, the hope is that more problems are solved than are created.

After a herculean effort from the entire engineering team at Rapyuta Robotics, the Beta generation of our drone and docking station was deployed for field testing and customer evaluation. The promotional video linked below gives an overview of some of the features of the system, as well as some of its capabilities.
