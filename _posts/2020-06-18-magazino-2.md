title: New TORUs in Krefeld
---

Working on the hardware side of things, the slower iteration cycles (compared to software) can sometimes be frustrating. One of my major projects at Magazino is developing our Shoebox Handler, a multi-axis suction array based manipulator, and making any changes to it involves tons of testing and coordination with our software teams, as this manipulator is our interface to the rest of the world.

Over the course of more than a year, we've been working to improve the design of the Shoebox Handler by integrating better sensors, making assembly easier and bringing down costs through DFM changes. I'm happy to say that the effort finally paid off and the new hardware is live at the customer site!
